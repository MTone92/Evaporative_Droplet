1. function M1, M2, N1, N2 is checked to be right.
2. function LegendreP and GegenC is checked to be right.
3. function J and Ja are checked to be right.
4. From the numerical test, dJda is correct which implies that Ja is correct.
5. From the numerical test, dbcdt needs to be revisited (5% error).
6. From the numerical test, Vbc appears to be right.
7. From the numerical test, psi_bc is not correct. However, when we refine our grid, psi_bc appears to be correct.

20201222:
1. J is tested to be right.
2. dbcdt is tested to be wrong with 10% error. However, it may due to less integration terms.
3. From the numerical test, errors in Vbc appears to be from the errors in dbcdt.
4. From the numerical test, errors in psi_bc is due to errors in dbcdt.
5. From the numerical test, errors in psi_bc_bar is due to errors in psi_bc.
6. Ja, dJda appear to be correct.

7. K and K_bar is hard to check due to less integral terms, however, their expression is checked to be right.

Overall, we checked that the terms in "UniformEvaporationChecker.jl" should be all correct.

20201223:
By the current results for 90 degree diffusive evaporation and comparing it to uniform evaporation, we found:
1. da1 is set to be 0.001 for getting accurate integration for correct results.
2. Most of the inaccuracy appear near the surface, which can be approximated by surface stream function.
3. Another inaccuracy appears at r near 0.88, which is the location of maximum stream function.
3.5 psi_bc is correct and psi_bc_bar is correct.
4. Accuracy in calculating K, K_bar don't match.
4.1 The mismatch in K is due to less alpha terms.
4.2 The mismatch in K_bar is still unkonw.
5. By numerical testing, dJda is accurate.

20201224:
1. The mismatch in K and K_bar in 90 degree case is inevitable cause:
1.1 one case is based on decay in edge assumption and the other one is based on uniform evaporation.
1.2 the convergence of K is strongly dependent on the value of psi_bc and converges very slowly, while we cannot have too many terms in alpha direction.
1.3 K_bar is convergent but it's value is determined be the edge decay assumption strongly.

Comparison:
bc = 90 degree;
Maximum stream function value = 0.25, appears at r = 0.87 on surface, a = 1.3331

Summary:
1. It has been checked that the code before calculating K and K_bar is correct!
2. Calculating of K is hard to converge since its expression is hard to reach 0 with small a (like a = 100).
3. Calculating of K_bar is not easy to match theoritical value due to evaporation is assumed to decay after a > 7.
3.5. Calculation of K and K_bar at b=90 cannot match the theoretical value either due to 2 or 3 or maybe other reasons.
4. It has been proved that a = 20 with da = 0.001 is a good value set for calculating stream function with accepted tolerance.
5. a = 50 is not a good value for calculating stream function.
5.1 Good value of a for calculating stream function is 7 < a <20, including 7 and 20.
5.1 However, with a increasing, the spuriou oscillation of stream function near the drop surface enlarges.
5.2 Thus, 7 or 7.1 is suggested in calculation.
6. The above statement is also valid for assumption: when a > 7, J = J(a=7). And the results by this assumption is almost the same if we assume exponetially decay.
